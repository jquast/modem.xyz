We want the list of bbs's and their banners,
- [ ] telnet banners captured in the correct encoding
- [x] and fonts
- [ ] perform automatic monthly scanning
- [ ] to *automatically* "moderate" away duplicates
- [ ] to be automatically updated, monthly
  - [ ] from https://mudstats.com/
  - [ ] from https://www.ipingthereforeiam.com/bbs/
  - [ ] some automatic moderation (eg. muds in bbslist.txt removed)
  - [x] also from https://www.commodorebbs.com/api/bbs 
        probably can't automate this, I had to copy & paste it
