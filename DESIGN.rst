We want the list of bbs's and their banners,
- [ ] telnet banners captured in the correct encoding
- [ ] and fonts (almost there!)
- [ ] to be automatically updated, monthly
  - [ ] from https://mudstats.com/
  - [ ] from https://www.ipingthereforeiam.com/bbs/
  - [ ] also from https://www.commodorebbs.com/api/bbs 
  - [ ] some automatic moderation (eg. muds in bbslist.txt removed)
- [ ] perform automatic scanning and sorting
- [ ] to automatically "moderate" away duplicates
