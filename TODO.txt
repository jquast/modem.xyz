We need per-application terminal sizes, eg.
- galaxy.silvren.com:2112 demands 90 columns or something
- 45.79.69.172 513 also

DONE?

Please examine the fingerprint json of the following servers, and, examine why were their banners so
poorly displayed, either by wrong encoding or maybe some "ansi stripping" gone wrong?

Bad encodings, please identify:
- breakworld.themuds.org
- 209.141.35.127

slightly bad formatting maybe?
- 210.59.236.38 3000
- 210.59.236.38 3000
- 210.59.236.38 3001

This is definitly the wrong encoding !
- 209.141.35.127 23

Why is this wrong ?? mystic bbs ??
- 23.151.152.245 23

Why was this CP437 bbs encoded as ascii???? or something is wrong ..
- 35.138.222.251 23
- 45.79.37.227 23
- 45.79.69.172 513
- 47.223.173.180 23
- 47.38.20.227 23
- 5.150.254.12 31337
- 23.151.152.245 23

I think we added "detect and display/encode as ascii if no cp437 characters are used", but this code
is corrupting and not detecting correctly.

This banner,
- 210.59.236.38 3003



-1.

Move data-muds/mudlist.txt and data-bbs/bbslist.txt to root folder.

Make sure to update all code, and, hyperlinks in our documentation.


TODO items,

Check website, https://www.commodorebbs.com/
- and compare their list of "Commodore BBS"s with ours
- adding to @bbslist.txt as necessary.
- most bbs's that run on a C64 are in PETSCII,
- Amiga is in 'topaz'
- Linux/Synchronet go ahead and check, many are cp437 and should remain


Some banners are completely empty, ""! We should be able to add to our moderation.py, should propose
option to remove all logfiles of all "empty" banners, or, delete them from bbslist.txt and
mudlist.txt, or skip/do nothing.

This way we can easily re-scan them. Maybe they were having a bad day. a CLI argument for
banner-lines-minimum=1 default, we can check 2, 3, or 4-line banners too, individually for
"rescan" (delete logfile), delete (remove from bbs/mudlist),

I could swear we already had something like that!


---

"23.95.146.28 8282" contains 'http://forum.revivialworld.org/...html' in the banner,
but why isn't it extracted with 'Server Info' item of Websites?

Similarly, for auto-detection of bbs software,
- Detect bbs software, by "bbs100" in banner, at least 1, 52.40.49.152 23
- and any "GALACTICOMM" in a banner is "MajorBBS" software
- Also, categorize "Renegade" as Renegade BBS.

1.

search data for occurrence of word 'ATASCII' and 'ATARI', check encoding against bbslist and
mudlist.txt, they may require 'atascii' encoding

2.


4.

All Enigma1/2 bbs's have some encoding error that looks like
a terminal error ??  https://bbs.modem.xyz/server_detail/fc62c63bc2cd14a0.html

kitty
do these need "ambiguous_width=wide" ?? I bet so !!
not possible by kitty, possible with WezTerm

and neither is bold as bright, jesus ..



7.

crt effect on images, by post-processing
- bloom by brightness if possible
- and scanlines

1.

- add country name and flag emoji of IP address (shodan? something cheap!!)

--

When showing "This server responded with an EMSI handshake sequence", should the fidonet details on
the server page. And, put this information under "Telnet Fingerprint", and, make each telnet
fingerprint thing itemized, eg:

Telnet Fingerprint

- Data source: cfa317a91359cb0b/2e9a6aa81240e9f5.json
- Server fingerprint is cfa317a91359cb0b[clipboard copy button],
  - This fingerprint shared by 33 other servers.
- Session finger print is 2e9a6aa81240e9f5[clipboard copy button],
- Options offered by server: BINARY, ECHO, SGA
- Options requested from client: BINARY, SGA

Also, we hyperlink to github for the raw json data, "Data source:", remove that.
